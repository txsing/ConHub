# ConHub
## A Metadata Management System for Docker Containers
ConHub is a management platform designed for Docker containers to manage their metadata, it arms the original
Docker client (1.12.2) with strong/flexible querying ability.

Moreover, ConHub exposes serveral APIs, based on which we developed a built-in parser for a new designed query language CQL(Container Query Language)
and several Container Visualization tools.
